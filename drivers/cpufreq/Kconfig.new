config CPU_FREQ
	bool "CPU Frequency scaling"
	help
	  CPU Frequency scaling allows you to change the clock speed of 
	  CPUs on the fly. This is a nice method to save power, because 
	  the lower the CPU clock speed, the less power the CPU consumes.

	  Note that this driver doesn't automatically change the CPU
	  clock speed, you need to either enable a dynamic cpufreq governor
	  (see below) after boot, or use a userspace tool.

	  For details, take a look at <file:Documentation/cpu-freq>.

	  If in doubt, say N.

	help
	  This driver exports CPU frequency statistics information through sysfs
	  file system.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called cpufreq_stats.

	  If in doubt, say N.

config CPU_FREQ_STAT_DETAILS

	help
	  This will show detail CPU frequency translation table in sysfs file
	  system.

	prompt "Default CPUFreq governor"
	default CPU_FREQ_DEFAULT_GOV_USERSPACE if CPU_FREQ_SA1100 || CPU_FREQ_SA1110
	default CPU_FREQ_DEFAULT_GOV_PERFORMANCE
	help
	  This option sets which CPUFreq governor shall be loaded at
	  startup. If in doubt, select 'performance'.

config CPU_FREQ_DEFAULT_GOV_PERFORMANCE
	bool "performance"
	select CPU_FREQ_GOV_PERFORMANCE
	help
	  Use the CPUFreq governor 'performance' as default. This sets
	  the frequency statically to the highest frequency supported by
	  the CPU.

config CPU_FREQ_DEFAULT_GOV_ONDEMAND
	bool "ondemand"
	select CPU_FREQ_GOV_ONDEMAND
	select CPU_FREQ_GOV_PERFORMANCE
	help
	  Use the CPUFreq governor 'ondemand' as default. This allows
	  you to get a full dynamic frequency capable system by simply
	  loading your cpufreq low-level hardware driver.
	  Be aware that not all cpufreq drivers support the ondemand
	  governor. If unsure have a look at the help section of the
	  driver. Fallback governor will be the performance governor.

config CPU_FREQ_GOV_PERFORMANCE
	tristate "'performance' governor"
	help
	  This cpufreq governor sets the frequency statically to the
	  highest available CPU frequency.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called cpufreq_performance.

	  If in doubt, say Y.

config CPU_FREQ_GOV_ONDEMAND
	tristate "'ondemand' cpufreq policy governor"
	select CPU_FREQ_TABLE
	help
	  'ondemand' - This driver adds a dynamic cpufreq policy governor.
	  The governor does a periodic polling and 
	  changes frequency based on the CPU utilization.
	  The support for this governor depends on CPU capability to
	  do fast frequency switching (i.e, very low latency frequency
	  transitions). 

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called cpufreq_ondemand.

	  For details, take a look at linux/Documentation/cpu-freq.

	  If in doubt, say N.

config CPU_FREQ_GOV_SMARTASSV2
	tristate "'smartassV2' cpufreq policy governor"
	depends on CPU_FREQ
	select CPU_FREQ_TABLE
	help
	  'smartassV2' - Is a good choice for a high performance 
	  governor

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called cpufreq_ondemand.

	  For details, take a look at linux/Documentation/cpu-freq.

	  If in doubt, say N.

config CPU_FREQ_GOV_LAZY
	tristate "'Lazy' cpufreq policy governor"
	depends on CPU_FREQ
	select CPU_FREQ_TABLE
	help
	  'Lazy' - Is like Ondemand, but with SOMF option for DI

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called cpufreq_ondemand.

	  For details, take a look at linux/Documentation/cpu-freq.

	  If in doubt, say N.
